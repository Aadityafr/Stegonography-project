The project aims to provide a simple yet effective approach for securely storing and transmitting sensitive data in the form of images. The system utilizes the AES algorithm, a symmetric encryption algorithm known for its robustness and speed, to encrypt data. It supports hiding any type of data, not limited to text, within images. The front end of the project is developed using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications, while the backend was implemented in Python. Our team Piyush Ghante, Sanket Pote, Avdhoot Fulsundar, Phinehas Mane and myself, collaborated and successfully completed the project.
